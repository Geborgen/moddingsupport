# Modding Support
Discord bot providing Nexus search functionality based off the r/skyrimmods modlinkbot and JonathanFeenstra's Discord modlinkbot, along with various commands linking to tutorials and resources for Skyrim modding.

"Modlink" portion and core code created by Arbigate, with miscellaneous commands by Geborgen.

The bot primarily operates in the [r/skyrim Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyrim) and [Geb's World](https://discord.com/invite/WC9ZqcTsmd).
