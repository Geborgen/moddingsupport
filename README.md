# Modding Support
Discord bot providing Nexus search functionality based off the r/skyrimmods modlinkbot and [JonathanFeenstra's Discord modlinkbot](https://github.com/JonathanFeenstra/discord-modlinkbot) and includes various commands linking to tutorials and resources for Skyrim modding.

Originally built for the [r/skyrim Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/skyrim), the bot is now open for public use.
